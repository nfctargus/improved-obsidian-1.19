# improved-obsidian-1.19
My first Minecraft mod! Obsidian is very under used so I am working on adding more decorative blocks and tools using obsidian.

Obsidian Shards are central to progressing in this mod, which can be obtained by mining Obsidian.
Next, combine the Obsidian Shards with Netherite Ingots in the Obsidian Grinder to make Obsiderite Dust.
Obsiderite Dust can be smelted in the Obsiderite Infusing Station with lava or another energy source to get Obsiderite Ingots.
You can craft your Obsiderite gear in the Smithing Table by combining a Netherite item with an Obsiderite Ingot.
